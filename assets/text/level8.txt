We meet at last. You’ve proved yourself worthy by passing all my trials.
Pledge your soul to me and I’ll make you my most treasured slave.
[No thanks. But you can join my harem.]
What are your trying to accomplish? You think you can enslave demons to your will?
[I can offer coffee, turn based strategies and chocolate pancakes.]
Really? Is that it? You come here, and try to buy me over with pancakes?
You’re lucky I have a thing for pancakes.
