Another batch of pancakes done, I see.
And it’s soooooo good…
Don’t mentioned it. It’s the least I can do.
Though I have to say,
I still can’t figure out how you get them perfectly thin every time.
And the way you spin them in the air. There must be some sorcery involved.
Yeah sure. better go give everyone their pancakes.
